Introduction
A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.
A stack in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). In a stack, both insertion and deletion take place from just one end, that is, from the top.

Operations Performed on Stacks
The following are the basic operations served by stacks.

push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
isEmpty: Checks whether the stack is empty.
isFull: Checks whether the stack is full.
top: Displays the topmost element of the stack.

IMPLEMENTING STACK
Statically: Array implementation of stacks allows the static memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the stack acquires all the features of an array.
Dynamically: Linked list implementation of stacks follow the dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the stack inherits all the characteristics of a linked list in C.
